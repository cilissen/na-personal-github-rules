# Personal GitHub Rules

Just some personal rules to remind myself of.

## Repository Name

{programming_language}-{lower_case_name_of_project_seperated_by_minus}

> example: python-project-name

## Commit Style

Sentence-case but no period at the end of sentence. For quick development changes just use the "Dev" commit message, otherwise just a quick general description of the changes.

> example: Improved the thing with the thing

> example: Dev
